# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) - Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the code and experimental setup for my Bachelor's Thesis on Speech Emotion Recognition. It implements various deep learning approaches and neural network architectures across different datasets.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by dataset:

*   **Emo_DB**: Experimental Setup for the Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (Emo-DB).
*   **TESS**: Experimental Setup for the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS).
*   **MSP_Podcast_Corpus**: Experimental Setup for the MSP-Podcast corpus.
*   **Open_Smile_Features**: Alternative dataset creation approach for Emo-DB using OpenSmile configuration files.

## Datasets

*   **Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (Emo-DB)**
*   **Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)**
*   **MSP-Podcast Corpus**

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each dataset folder contains specific training scripts and READMEs with further details.

### Emo-DB
Navigate to the `Emo_DB` directory to find training scripts like `Train_Berlin_EmoDB.py`.

### TESS
Navigate to the `TESS` directory for `train_TESS.py`.

### MSP Podcast Corpus
Navigate to the `MSP_Podcast_Corpus` directory for `train_t1.py` and `train_t2.py`.
