# OpenSmile Features

## Background

During the project, I extracted eGeMAPS features from Emo-DB using OpenSmile. However, initially I only created a training and test dataset. I then split the training dataset into training and validation sets within the trainer.

During the process, I realized it would be more sensible to create three separate datasets from the start. Due to time constraints, I did not pursue this approach further.
